## Overview
Potato plants are susceptible to various diseases that can significantly impact crop yield and quality. This project aims to automate disease detection in potato plants using deep learning, making it easier for agricultural stakeholders to identify and manage crop diseases efficiently.

### Key Objectives
Identify late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans).
Identify early blight (caused by Alternaria solani).
Distinguish healthy potato leaves from diseased ones.
### Future Work
-Develop a web-based interface or mobile app for farmers to use the model in real time.
